# TODO:
#  Implement the following
#  1.) Postprocessed Dataset reading
#  2.) Computation of CoM
#  3.) Computation of Moment of Inertia
#  4.) Computation of Total Body Angular Momentum (2 functions: one for linear(?), one for angular momentum)
#  Split the function in more scripts, if more readable
#  Note: Apparently a lot of code needed, maybe I should just implement the computation and not the whole thing

# Following function might not be necessary
